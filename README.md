# Neural-Network-to-Predict-Bike-sharing-patterns-
## 1.Introduction :
**Goal:** Build a neural network to predict bike sharing rides.<br>
**Dataset:** The core data set is related to  the two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA which is 
publicly available in [dataset](http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data) And further informations about the dataset can be sounf here :
